by Daniel Lerps


Small application which can encrypt and decrypt messages 
with an enhanced playfair alphabet of 100 characters.

The EncryptionEngine class is abstract and allows other 
cryptographic implementations.

Application can be started with the main(args) method and 
takes 3 parameters. $1 the mode (--encryot or --decrypt),
$2 the key and $3 the message.
